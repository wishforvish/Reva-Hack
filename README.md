# Reva-Hack
This is the project on #Space Exploration Plaza: Up, up and AwayðŸš€!! This is built in the National Level Hacakthon of 36 hours at Reva University by the students of Sri Krishna Institute Of Technology.

Project Description and Introduction:
We reasearched online to understand the needs and interests of our target audience - teenagers.
With analysis we came up with an idea of attractive website for space education and outreach. 
Teenagers are often unaware of the benefits of space exploration and the potential of the space industry.
This lack of awareness can lead to a lack of support for space exploration programs and initiatives.

Solution :
We have developed a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap that aims to create awareness of space among teenagers.

 Table of Contents
You can include a table of contents to help users quickly navigate :
   â€¢ India's space history and missions
   â€¢ Educational resources related to space
   â€¢ Space 2060, a vision for the future of space exploration
   â€¢ Future space predictions
   â€¢ A fun zone with quizzes, puzzles, and a photo booth

Conclusion:

We hope that our website will play a role in inspiring the next generation of space explorers.
